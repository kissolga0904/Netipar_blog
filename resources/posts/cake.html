    First, with the help of an electric mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar for at least 5 minutes until the mixture is frothy and smooth.
    Meanwhile, in a small saucepan melt the butter over low heat, without letting it sizzle. Let it cool and then add the melted butter to the egg and sugar cream. Continue to mix for a few seconds on high speed until the mixture is well blended.
    Now add the grated lemon peel and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and continue to mix.
    Sift together the flour, baking powder and potato starch. Then, reduce the speed of the mixer and add the flours to the mixture, one tablespoon at a time.
    Mix on low speed, just long enough for the ingredients to thicken into a creamy mixture.
    Finally, pour everything into a baking dish, previously lined with baking paper. Carefully spread the mixture to level the surface.
    Wash your strawberries with a damp cloth, not under running water, and dry them perfectly with a dry cloth. This is an essential step. Moist strawberries are heavier and therefore tend to sink to the bottom, as well as overly moisten the batter.
    Now cut each strawberry into four equal-sized wedges.  Arrange them on top of the cake, covering it completely. Since you gently press the strawberries into the top of the batter, they will sink even more during baking. The cake looks great when you cut it and have the cooked strawberries in the center of the cake.
    Bake in a preheated oven at 170° C (340 F) for about 45 minutes, in the middle rack of the oven. The cake’ll be ready when a golden crust forms on the surface.
    Remove your easy fresh strawberry cake from the oven and let it cool, then sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.
