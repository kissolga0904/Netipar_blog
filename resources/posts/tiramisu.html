    First of all, make the coffee. Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites until stiff: you will get at it when the egg whites will not move if you turn the bowl over.
    Remember that to whip egg whites to stiff peaks, there should be no trace of yolk. Once ready, set aside.
    Now, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.
    In the meantime, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer.When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone cheese.
    Using the flexible-edge k-beater, slowly whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites. Mix slowly until smooth and creamy.
    Now letâ€™s prepare the layers of ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. You can make 2 or more layers, depending on the width and depth of your pan.
    Dip the ladyfingers quickly (1 or 2 seconds) into the coffee. Then arrange the ladyfingers in the casserole of your liking.
    Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.
    Allow to rest 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
